Goal: Try Federated Averaging (simulations) for improving Neural Semantic Parsing.

This is a new intern project for Summer 2020.

## Milestone 1 
### Timeline May 18, 2020 - May 29, 2020
- Implemented and trained a transformer-based model to match SOTA (without federation)

## Milestone 1 
### Timeline June 1, 2020 - June 30, 2020
- Generate non-IID splits of ATIS and Snips dataset.
- Train a baseline federated model for both the non-IID splits and the IID-splits.
- Bridge the gap between the model trained with the IID and non-IId splits.
